#IN ORDER, we have the following variables:
#specie_fraction_array: line 15 -- gaseous/refractory species amount
#dust_base_frac: line 16 --based on pre-existing mass-weighted dust profile
#DUST_FRAC: line 17 --dust fraction by mass overall, computed with helper code
#MASS_FRACTION_GMC: line 18 --fraction of *total* galactic mass turned into GMCs at this tick (default: 0.005^N)

####
# Assume that only a certain fraction of the mass of the galaxy is contained in molecular
# clouds at any one time, and then assume that dust/refractory species created in each
# iteration distributes itself uniformly throughout the galaxy's mass. New molecular clouds
# will be formed using these parameters. The "config-00" file will contain an initial setup
# with no dust.
